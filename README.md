## Manga App â€” Le Collectif

This manga app lets you add manga to your list, favorite them and label them as read. You can use the genre filter to see which manga belong to which genre. You can also use the Read & Favourite filter to see which manga have been read or favorited.

A separate input form lets you add a new manga to the list by providing a title, an author, an image link to a cover and the number of volumes. After the manga has been created, you can also attribute up to three genres to this newly created entry in your reading list.

The Frontend service has been commented out in the docker-compose.yml file for a specific reason.

This is why I am starting the frontend project separately from the docker containers.
